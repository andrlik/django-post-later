# Quickstart

A simple django app for scheduling posts for Twitter, Mastodon, and others.

## Installation

In order to properly validate media uploads we use the `python-magic` library. As a result, you will need to have `libmagic` installed on your system. You can find [installation instructions here.](https://pypi.org/project/python-magic/) The python library will otherwise be automatically installed when you install post_later.

To do so, run `pip install django-post-later`.

## Configuration
